        <p>Now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary.</p>
        <p>A tabernacle was set up. In its first room were the lampstand and the table with its consecrated bread; this was called the Holy Place. </p>
        <p>Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place, </p>
        <p>which had the golden altar of incense and the gold-covered ark of the covenant. 
            This ark contained the gold jar of manna, Aaron’s staff that had budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant.</p>
        <p>Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover. But we cannot discuss these things in detail now. </p>
        <p>When everything had been arranged like this, the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry.</p>
        <p>But only the high priest entered the inner room, and that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.</p>
        <p>The Holy Spirit was showing by this that the way into the Most Holy Place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still functioning. </p>
        <p>This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper. </p>
        <p>They are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings—external regulations applying until the time of the new order.</p>
